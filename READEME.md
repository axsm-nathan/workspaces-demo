## API Directory

The `api` directory should be used for API endpoint code that will be provided to clients/frontend applications like brand websites.

## Events Directory

The `events` directory should be used for asynchronous/event-bus operations. Axsome's API operations rely on asynchronous, event-driven code. This can be triggered with Amazon EventBridge or other asynchronous triggers and organized in the `events` directory.
